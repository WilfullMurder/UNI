# UNI
Make-work (busy work) I set myself while at Uni






1st Year software engineering degree. Asked for more challenging work and was ignored.
I've decide to make a repo for algorithms in various languages.
I will probably just keep expanding with more make-work after I am done with algorithms
PYTHON and JAVA are being covered at uni so I plan to start with them first.
I have experience with C# and C++ so I will move across to those afterwards.
Or possibly just keep delving deeper.
