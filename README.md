# UNI
Make-work (busy work) I set myself while at Uni






1st Year software engineering degree. Asked for more challenging work and was ignored.
I've decide to make a repo for algorithms in various languages.
I will probably just keep expanding with more make-work after I am done with algorithms
PYTHON and JAVA are being covered at uni.
C# and C++ are not.
regardless I am self taught.
